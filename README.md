# Work-Day Scheduler

## Purpose of the Scheduler

This page will present the user with the current day and time, and an agenda-view of the working hours in the day. These hour blocks will be presented differently to the user, depending on what time of day the user is interacting with the page. The user will see an editable text box for each hour where they can enter tasks that they would like to complete within that hour of the day. There is a "save" button to the right of each hour block, and when that is clicked, the user's input will be stored in local storage. This will allow the user to refresh the page without losing their hourly tasks. Hopefully, this allows employees to be more efficient with their time!

## My Experience

This was actually a pretty straightforward challenge. Referencing some of the correct variables tripped me up a few times, but overall I really like the way jquery functions. This challenge also allowed me to work on just one piece at a time, and then once those pieces were working, I could just copy/paste and reassign the correct variables. Overall, this challenge has given me more confidence to use jquery whenever I can.
